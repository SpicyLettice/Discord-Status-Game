Note: This isnt my creation just making a how to.
Firstly, you will need to open discords devlopers portal. From here you can creatr your application.

Now your on the discord devlopers page. 
Click the New Applications button. Found at the top right.

Now give your application a name. This will show up on the final product so choose wisely.

After you've named the application. You should see this. You will need to come back to this later.

Now you should see this, click on Rich Presence and it should bring you to a art assets.

Add a profile image and two images by clicking the addd images button.
Note: Images need to be 512 x 512 for the min or 1024 x 1024 for the max size.

You should now see something like this. 
Note: Images will take time to process. This is because discord needs to verify the content.

![Screenshot 2022-04-29 at 15 51 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103954090/165969116-d2a2fbdb-17cf-4cc9-9679-77ed3915eef1.png)


Now head over to visualizer

![Screenshot 2022-04-29 at 15 51 48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103954090/165969342-cfaa0550-e348-4ffb-9b46-fa1b193fa5ac.png)


Now you can edit anything you want. These will show up in your profile.


![Screenshot 2022-04-29 at 15 53 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103954090/165969561-7bda3d6d-18ad-48ad-9ff2-a0ebca2a7ee4.png)

Now its time to add Better discord. Here are the links.

https://betterdiscord.app/
https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/ZeresPluginLibrary

Download these and add them to your discord. 
Heres a link to a how to videos.
Mac os - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IPJLcLKHJM
Windows - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP84aObEi9A

Now, you should see this in your discord. If not retry and and rewatch the videos.

![Screenshot 2022-04-29 at 16 04 36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103954090/165971629-74fc6965-ed8a-494c-9c94-7d57faa38b80.png)

Click plugins and add this into the plugin folder,
https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/ZeresPluginLibrary

You can find your plugin folder through the 'show plugin folder' after clicking on plugins.

![Screenshot 2022-04-29 at 16 06 27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103954090/165971994-bc2b7a21-fbc1-4cef-89b3-09ca0d472c53.png)

Once you've added the plug in. It should show up here. YOU WILL NEED TO ENABLE IT.

Now guessing you've done everything right you can now add the Rich Presence to theplug in.

![Screenshot 2022-04-29 at 16 09 14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103954090/165972466-72dba9b7-d53f-4429-b2e8-6b7193d53eab.png)

You will need your APPLICATION ID which is in the General Information. This is the place i sais "you need this later"
Now you can copy and paste all the infomation found in Rich Presence Visualizer. Make sure its exactly the same on the visualixer and the plugin.

![Screenshot 2022-04-29 at 16 16 25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103954090/165973701-7959ec16-cbad-4236-8368-41b8616bdd74.png)

Now if you scroll down far enough. You should see "button 1 label" This is the name of your button.
Just below it there is "Button 1 url" Putt the hhtps url here. This will redirect people to the link.

Futher Notes: Some devices bug out and wont be able to use the buttons. This is a bug. So far i haven't found any work around. Also, the device you've set this up on wont be able to access the buttons. Thos is another bug. But it dose work just log in on alt or get a friend to test it.

Also, this will disappear if the device its set up on is in sleep or shut down.
Therefore, if u set this up on a laptop and closed down your laptop it will disapper.
